# eScada-HMI
eScada The essential cross-platform HMI solution.

- eScada doesnâ€™t require any installation procedure nor compilation, because it is designed to be used on removable supports, without any dependencies with the OS or other frameworks.
- Thanks to eScada features you can choose the OS and the hardware that fits your needs, because it is an independent SW with a series of interesting properties.
- From everywhere in your company, or from a remote site, you can operate with your equipment as you were in front of it.
- A powerful set of entirely configurable HMI development tools available for a wide range of applications.

# About
First of all, welcome to this site, and thank you for taking time to read this text.<br>
You are wondering why another SCADA with so many available choices

Developing HMI solutions, often we have noticed that the cost for purchasing the run-time and development licenses was even more than the cost related to development time.<br>
Another important thing we have noticed is that normally to reach the goal, you need to use few functions compared to the many features at your disposition.<br>
Again in the worst situation, every feature you need must be paid apart from the initial cost.<br>

In other words, we were tired to pay many money even for a simple HMI solution.

In 2012 we started this project called "eScada HMI solution" where (e) stands for essential.<br>
It is essential because it aims to implement the essential features you normally need.<br>
After all this development time a very cheap HMI solution has came, with many interesting features.

# Development tools and run-time license
There is no need to pay for the development tools, they can be used to implement a real solution without any restriction.<br>
<ins>Please, keep in mind that, you will be able to try everything and only if you will be satisfied you will buy the license for the final run-time use.</ins><br>
Without a valid run-time license the only restriction is the run-time component will work for one hour.<br>

- You will pay only for the run-time license.
- The license will be valid for the OS family and device chosen.
Device stands for: internal or external hard disks, USB keys, CD cards, CF cards, ....<br>
OS Family stands for: Windows or Linux
